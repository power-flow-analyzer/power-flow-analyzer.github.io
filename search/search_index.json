It was developed at the Technical University Berlin with the main purpose to support actual and future research on small and large scale electrical networks (e.g. transmission and distribution networks in Germany). PFA allows to create powerful network diagrams with true geographic coordinates containing error flags, line flows, additional markers and border outlines. Further contour diagrams can be created to visualise trends and patterns in large scale power systems. Its user interface allows to aggregate network elements at multiple levels, such as the operator, region, substation or voltage level. Networks and the elements they contain are defined by abstract parameters which are specified in an hierarchical database, allowing to use different sets of parameters for each network. A built-in database for standard Matpower networks is included. It interfaces to Matlab and allows to define and execute custom scripts with individual script parameters for e.g. the import of networks from Excel files and the calculation of power flows. Features Core Features explorative graphical analysis of transmission and distribution grid data definition of custom workflows using predefined Matlab scripts Matpower integration for computing (optimal) power flows management of projects, networks, scripts and parameters graphical user interface (GUI) for management and analysis tasks Visualisations visualise grid topology and regions using geographic maps explore grid characteristics using the network browser use heat maps to analyze trends and patterns in large systems draw direction of (active) power flow on all lines define custom error levels for all grid assets aggregate and filter network data at multiple levels Interfaces Matlab: execute functions and define parameters graphically; generic interface for all proprietary data formats Matpower: compute (optimal) power flow, PTDFs, LODFs, ... Excel: optimised loading routines for easy and fast accesss UCTE DEF: import grid data suitable for grid operators Runtime Environment no installation required: download, unzip, start in Matlab workflows may be intiated from GUI and/or in batch processing platform independant due to its nature, although only Windows is tested License open source license (Apache Version 2.0), suitable both for research and enterprises the full source code and build files are available for download from Github","title":"Home"},{"location":"#powerflowanalyzer","text":"PowerFlowAnalyzer (PFA) is a software tool for visualising and analysing different network topologies along with their data.

A new folder PowerFlowAnalyzer-<VERSION> will be created. The final name is version dependant (e.g. PowerFlowAnalyzer-2.3.0 ). Open the newly created folder and execute the start script in Matlab: >> pfa_start_application.m The graphical user interface (GUI) will open in a new window: Open an example project Click the button on the toolbar. A new window will open. Select or enter the path to the project file <PATH TO PFA>/examples/matpower/matpower.case of your PFA installation. Click OK . Select the item IEEE 14 Bus Test Case in the Overview area on the left side. The item will be highlighted. A network summary similar to Matpower will be show: You can change the name of a network and add a description in the Network information tab: By double clicking an item in the Overview area, the network will be shown: The user interface offers basically three different visualisation types for network data: network maps drawing grid topology data and heat maps network browsers allowing to explore data in a hyperlink like style data tables listing specific elements and their parameters Selecting an item in a visualisation will update all other visualisations to reflect the current selection. Compute power flow with Matpower Click the button on the toolbar. A dialog will open and show the available scripts. Click on 2. Calculate Power Flow . The script parameter dialog will show up. Select AC Standard as the power flow algorithm. Click OK . This particular script will perform the following actions: convert network data into the Matpower case format compute power flow using Matpower functions convert calculation results into network data update user interface Take a look at the Matlab console to view the logging output of the PFA and Matpower functions. Click on one of the red dots in the network viewer to see which constraint was violated: Load other IEEE Test Cases Switch back to the Overview panel and select the action Create empty network : Now execute the script 1. Import Matpower Case : The script parameter dialog will show up. Select an input Matpower case (e.g. IEEE 30 Bus Test Case ). Click OK . Select the newly created network in the list, change its name and view it by double clicking on it's list item. Grouping assets by specific models or parameters may reduce significantly the information shown in the user interface.
